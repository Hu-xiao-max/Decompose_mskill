This repo contains the implementation of the benchmark mentioned in the title.
It also contains an example integration with RVT, one of the baselines from the
study. The code for the benchmark builds on top of [PyRep][0], and integrates
with [RLBench][1], implementing 20 out of the original 100 tasks.
